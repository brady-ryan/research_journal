Next Step: start looking at some of the work that others have done, and come up with a plan for what set of masses would make an interesting paper

Revis et. al. (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac8b06/pdf)

- 0.981M<sub>solar</sub>  C/O Core
- 0.050M<sub>solar</sub>  Helium shell with 0.008M<sub>solar</sub> C/O fluff. 
- Isothermal model
- 3GK initial burst that is 32km in radius and centered 100km above the core.
- Core detonation at ~1.50s

Fink et. al. (https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2010/06/aa13892-09.pdf)

- Various initial adiabatic models:

| Model| Core | Shell | Total |
|------|------|-------|-------|
| 1    | 0.810| 0.126 | 0.936 |
| 2    | 0.920| 0.084 | 1.004 |
| 3    | 1.025| 0.055 | 1.08  |
| 4    | 1.164| 0.039 | 1.164 |
| 5    | 1.280| 0.013 | 1.293 |
| 6    | 1.3885|0.0035| 1.3885|

Another table with the conditions at the core detonation of all models is given. Model 3 most closely resembles Rivas et. al. 

| Model| t (s)| z (km)| T (10e9 K) |
|------|------|-------|-------|
| 3    | 1.58 | -1750 | 4.42  |
