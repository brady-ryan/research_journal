Next Step: start looking at some of the work that others have done, and come up with a plan for what set of masses would make an interesting paper

Revis et. al. (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac8b06/pdf)

Methods:
- **FLASH-X** solves the compressible Euler equations on a Eulerian grid via a finite volume method.
- **aprox13** nuclear reactive network

- 0.981M<sub>solar</sub>  C/O Core
- 0.050M<sub>solar</sub>  Helium shell with 0.008M<sub>solar</sub> C/O fluff. 
- Isothermal model
- 3GK initial burst that is 32km in radius and centered 100km above the core.
- Core detonation at ~1.58s

Fink et. al. (https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2010/06/aa13892-09.pdf)

Methods:
- reactive Euler equations are solved using a finite volume scheme based on the **PROMETHEUS** code

Various initial adiabatic models:

| Model| Core | Shell | Total |
|------|------|-------|-------|
| 1    | 0.810| 0.126 | 0.936 |
| 2    | 0.920| 0.084 | 1.004 |
| 3    | 1.025| 0.055 | 1.08  |
| 4    | 1.164| 0.039 | 1.164 |
| 5    | 1.280| 0.013 | 1.293 |
| 6    | 1.3885|0.0035| 1.3885|

Another table with the conditions at the core detonation of all models is given. Model 3 most closely resembles Rivas et. al. 

| Model| t (s)| z (km)| T (10e9 K) |
|------|------|-------|-------|
| 3    | 1.58 | -1750 | 4.42  |


Boos et. al (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.12330.pdf)

Methods:
- **FLASH**: reactive fluid dynamics
- **MESA**: nuclear reaction networks
- By mass, the core compositions are 0.4 ¹²C, 0.587 ¹⁶O, and 0.013 ²²Ne. The shell compositions are 0.891 ⁴He, 0.05 ¹²C, 0.009 ¹⁴N, and 0.05 ¹⁶O.

11 different simulations:
- For 10 sims: the shock wave converged some distance from the symmetry axis, causing the core detonation
- The only progenitor that had a systematically unique detonation was the thickest-shell case (M<sub>tot</sub> = 1.0 M&#9733, M<sub>sh</sub> = 0.1 M&#9733)
