1) Organized all simulations from Rivas, Fink, Boos, and Townsley into Google Sheet in order to more effectively determine useful new simulation parameters. 
2) Starting test run of Zingale et. al. (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.01802.pdf) with new He-C-Fe-group network. 40 species?
- Runtime error, it seems as though the inputs file is being read multiple times, which creates multiple simulations, which then causes mixing of the names of checkpoint files, leading to a crash
