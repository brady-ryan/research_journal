**Boos et. al. Sims:**

1) Finished heavy shell at 20km resolution. Core detonation was caused by pressure wave convergence, directly dissenting from what is described in the paper.
2) Likewise, my simulation for the light shell at 20km resolution disagrees. Boos states that a pressure wave convergence ignites the CO core, but in my simulation I find that the pressure wave is not strong enough to lead to a supernova.

**He-C-Fe-group:**

1) After core detonation, the simulation runs into the error *too many subcycles.* I have tried changing from analytic to numerical Jacobian, as well as setting *castro.state_interp_order = 0.*
2) Running the most recent checkpoint on its own was successful, so the code has been updated to automatically switch Jacobian types if there are too many subcycles. Waiting to test and see if the simulation will now continue.
