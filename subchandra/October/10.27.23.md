#First Journal Entry

Brief summary of my project up to this point:

- Investigating double detonation in white dwarfs for understanding their role 
in Type 1a supernovae.
- Using computational simulations with the **Castro** simulation code.
- Focusing on varying white dwarf core and Helium layer masses.
- Gaining insights into critical factors influencing double detonations.
- Comparing results with existing models in scientific 
literature to validate and refine findings.

Mainly comparing against Revas et. al. ([https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac8b06/pdf]).

Initial parameters:
- 0.98$M_\odot$ C-O WD with a
