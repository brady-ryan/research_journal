##First Journal Entry

Brief summary of my project up to this point:

- Investigating double detonation in white dwarfs for understanding their role 
in Type 1a supernovae.
- Using computational simulations with the **Castro** simulation code.
- Focusing on varying white dwarf core and Helium layer masses.
- Gaining insights into critical factors influencing double detonations.
- Comparing results with existing models in scientific 
literature to validate and refine findings.

Mainly comparing against Rivas et. al. ([https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac8b06/pdf]).

Initial parameters:
- 0.981M<sub>solar</sub>  C-O WD with a 0.058M<sub>solar</sub>  envelope. This envelope is largely Helium, but also contains 5% Oxygen and 5% Carbon "fluff."
- Isothermal model.
- 3GK initial burst that is 32km in radius and centered 100km above the core.

Currently running 2 simulations:
1) subch_simple (1.28s)
2) aprox13 (1.5s)

Rivas et. al. claim that at resolutions coarser than 4km, the double detonation is caused by a flame front ignited at the antipode once the initial detonation wraps around the outer shell. At resolutions finer than 4km, they claim that the double detonation is caused by a compression wave convergence slightly off-center within the core.


I find that at resolutions up to 20km, in both isothermal and isentropic models, the subch_simple *and* aprox13 networks coincide with the results from the finest trials of Rivas et. al.
