#First Journal Entry

Brief summary of my project up to this point:

- Investigating double detonation in white dwarfs for understanding their role 
in Type 1a supernovae.
- Using computational simulations with the 'Castro' simulation code.
- Focusing on varying white dwarf core and Helium layer masses.
- Gaining insights into critical factors influencing double detonations.
- Comparing results with existing models in scientific 
literature to validate and refine findings.
