Brief summary of my project up to this point:

We aim to comprehensively investigate the phenomenon of double detonation in white dwarfs as a means to enhance our understanding of their potential role as progenitors of Type 1a supernovae. To achieve this goal, we will employ advanced computational simulations utilizing the Castro simulation code, a powerful tool for simulating astrophysical phenomena.
Our study will primarily focus on varying the masses of both the white dwarf core and the surrounding Helium layer, thereby examining a wide range of possible scenarios. This approach will enable us to gain insights into the critical factors that influence the likelihood and characteristics of double detonations in white dwarfs. By systematically comparing our results with existing models documented in the scientific literature, we aim to validate and refine our findings, contributing to the ongoing discourse in the field of supernova research.
